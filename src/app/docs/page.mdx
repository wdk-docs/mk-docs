Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a framework for building web applications.

With Next.js, you can build user interfaces using React components. Then, Next.js provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling for you, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time setting up tooling.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast web applications.

## Main Features

Some of the main Next.js features include:

| Feature                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| [Data Fetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching)       | Simplified data fetching with async/await support in React Components and the `fetch()`s API that aligns with React and the Web Platform.                                                        |

## How to Use These Docs

The sections and pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

At the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the **App Router** and the **Pages Router** features. Since there are features that are unique to each directory, it's important to keep track of which tab is selected.

On the right side of the page, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. The breadcrumbs at the top of the page will also indicate whether you're viewing App Router docs or Pages Router docs.

To get started, checkout the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation). If you're new to React or Server Components, we recommend reading the [React Essentials](/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) page.

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Although our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on Next.js functionality. We'll make sure to provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.

To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and React. If you need to brush up on your React skills, check out these resources:

- [React: Official React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn)
- [React Essentials](/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)

## Accessibility

For optimal accessibility when using a screen reader while reading the docs, we recommend using Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver.
